# Week 3 Mini-Team Challenge

1. Copy Vehicle.java and VehicleTestDrive.java to your labs directory.
2. The program has several bugs that you need to fix. Your goal is to fix the program so that when you run VehicleTestDrive, you receive the following output:

**The vehicle is a black 2012 Toyota 4Runner with 20.0-inch wheels**

3. If you are confused about where to start, here is one approach:
    1. Compile the classes. 
    2. Review the first compiler error, noting the class, line number, and error description.
    3. In the source code, review and fix the line indicated in the compiler error. 
    4. Recompile and confirm that error is fixed. Repeat!
